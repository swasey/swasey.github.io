Several works have recently shown that Android's security architecture
cannot prevent many undesired behaviors that compromise the integrity
of applications and the privacy of their data. This paper makes two
main contributions to the body of research on Android security: first,
it develops a formal framework for analyzing Android-style security
mechanisms; and, second, it describes the design and implementation of
Sorbet, an enforcement system that enables developers to use
permissions to specify secrecy and integrity policies. Our formal
framework is composed of an abstract model with several specific
instantiations. The model enables us to formally define some desired
security properties, which we can prove hold on Sorbet but not on
Android. We implement Sorbet on top of Android 2.3.7, test it on a
Nexus S phone, and demonstrate its usefulness through a case study.
