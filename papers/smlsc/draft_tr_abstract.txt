This is a proposal for an extension to the Standard ML programming
language to support separate compilation. The extension allows the
programmer to write a program broken into multiple fragments in a way
that would be compatible between different implementations. It also
allows for the separate compilation of these fragments, for
incremental recompilation strategies such as cut-off recompilation,
and for a range of implementation strategies including whole-program
compilation. The semantics of separate compilation is defined
independent of the underlying semantic framework for Standard ML and
is realized in two forms corresponding to The Definition of Standard
ML and The Typed Semantics of Standard ML.
