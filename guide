Deepak's research statement:

	A significant shortcoming in the security literature today
	is methods to model and prove security properties. Paul David Swasey's
	initial research work will focus on this direction; in particular,
	it will combine techniques from programming language theory,
	proof systems and formal verification to design a framework
	for modeling and proving security properties.
