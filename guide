Deepak's research statement:

	A significant shortcoming in the security literature today
	is methods to model and prove security properties. Paul David Swasey's
	initial research work will focus on this direction; in particular,
	it will combine techniques from programming language theory,
	proof systems and formal verification to design a framework
	for modeling and proving security properties.

A "promise" I struck from index.html:

<P>
In my initial research, I will focus on techniques for compositional
reasoning about secure systems. One of my concrete goals is to develop
a higher-order version of Garg et al's framework for modeling and
proving security properties in the presence of
