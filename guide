Look at

	http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/users/cek/publications.php

	1. The layout with links on the left and extra space between
	publications looks nice. Consider using CSS.
	
	2. The links "Publisher's site" and the note
	"All the PDFs provided above are preprint" seems much more
	friendly than Springer's suggestion.

	3. Avoid typing bibliographic details twice (later, three times):
	
	• consider building a master bibtex file listing my publications,
	my notes on them, etc.
	• generate my CV's publications sections from it
	• generate my paper's web page from it
	• generate a bibtex.html from it along the lines of Cezary's

	This involves either using the new bibtex thing or something
	along the lines of what I did for Fox Project publications.

Deepak's research statement:

	A significant shortcoming in the security literature today
	is methods to model and prove security properties. Paul David Swasey's
	initial research work will focus on this direction; in particular,
	it will combine techniques from programming language theory,
	proof systems and formal verification to design a framework
	for modeling and proving security properties.

A "promise" I struck from index.html:

	<!--
	<P>
	In my initial research, I will focus on techniques for compositional
	reasoning about secure systems. One of my concrete goals is to develop
	a higher-order version of Garg et al's framework for modeling and
	proving security properties in the presence of
